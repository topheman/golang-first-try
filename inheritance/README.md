Inheritance
===========

A simple example of inheritance in ES5/ES6 and GO (two languages that aren't really meant for that kind of use). Composition FTW!

To test:

```shell
node inheritance/inheritance-es5.js
node inheritance/inheritance-es6.js
go run inheritance/inheritance-go.go
```

Should output:

```
Georges is eating dog food
Georges barks!
Jules is happy to eat!
Jules barks!

```
